# What is cybersecurity?
Protection of computer systems to preserve and retain the confidentiality, integrity, availability (CIA) of their assets 
	Asset - Item of value that you want to protect i.e an empty bottle is worth nothing compared to a personal phone
	These can be
		Hardware - Computer, Devices (Disk, Memory, printers), Network Equipment
		Software - Operating system, commercial software (Office, Individual programs), Utilities
		Data - Doc's, Photos, Audio and Videos, Email, Coursework

Value is  dependent on asset itself and perspective of loss/harm
Off The Shelf - Replacements costs
	Replaceable
		Computers, Devices, Operating System, Utilities
Personal Data Assets - Unique and/or irreplaceable
	Unique and/or irreplaceable 
		Documents, Photos, Music, Email
Time dependent - Design documents for new product high value before release, no value 


# Vulnerabilities
Vulnerability - weakness in the information system (design, implementation, or procedures) that can be exploited to cause loss or 

Threat - Set of circumstances that has the potential to cause loss or harm, often through exploiting a vulnerability
	Natural Causes (Fire, power failure) or Human Causes
		Benign Intent (Human error) or Malicious Intent
			Random (Malicious code on a general website) or Directed (Impersonation)


Control(Countermeasure/Mitigation) - Protective measure (action, device, procedure or technique) that removes a vulnerability.
	Encryption - Scramble data so that its interpretation is meaningless
	Software Controls - Programs that enforce security e.g. check passwords and user rights
	Hardware Controls - Locks, intrusion detection, hardware implementation of encryption
	Policies and Procedures - Regular password changes, rules for accessing sensitive data


To study different ways of protection we use a Vulnerability-Threat-Control Framework that describes how assets may be harmed and how to counter or mitigate that harm


| Threats    | ->  | System of Assets    | <-  | Controls |
| ---------- | --- | ------------------- | --- | -------- |
| Cause Harm |     | Has Vulnerabilities |     | Protect  |


# CIA Triad
Confidentiality - Unauthorized people or systems cannot access protected assets 
	The harm is loss of it - How?
		An unauthorized person accesses a data item
		An unauthorized process or program access a data item
		A person authorized to access certain data accesses other data not authorized
		An unauthorized person accesses an approximate data value
		An unauthorized person learns the existence of piece of data

Integrity - Assets cannot be modified by unauthorized parties or in an unauthorized way 
		Modifications in this context depend on the asset; this includes writing, changing hardware, changing status, deleting and creating

Availability - Assets must be be accessible to authorized parties at appropriate times
		There are numerous characteristics with availability; a data item or service is deemed available if:
		It is present in a usable form
		It is making clear progress
		It completes in an acceptable period of time
		Requests are handled timely and fairly
		It can be used easily and in the way it was intended to be used
