Vulnerability - weakness in the information system (design, implementation, or procedures) that can be exploited to cause loss or 

Threat - Set of circumstances that has the potential to cause loss or harm, often through exploiting a vulnerability
	Natural Causes (Fire, power failure) or Human Causes
		Benign Intent (Human error) or Malicious Intent
			Random (Malicious code on a general website) or Directed (Impersonation)


Control(Countermeasure/Mitigation) - Protective measure (action, device, procedure or technique) that removes a vulnerability.
	Encryption - Scramble data so that its interpretation is meaningless
	Software Controls - Programs that enforce security e.g. check passwords and user rights
	Hardware Controls - Locks, intrusion detection, hardware implementation of encryption
	Policies and Procedures - Regular password changes, rules for accessing sensitive data


To study different ways of protection we use a Vulnerability-Threat-Control Framework that describes how assets may be harmed and how to counter or mitigate that harm


| Threats    | ->  | System of Assets    | <-  | Controls |
| ---------- | --- | ------------------- | --- | -------- |
| Cause Harm |     | Has Vulnerabilities |     | Protect  |
