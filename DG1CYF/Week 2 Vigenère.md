Vigen√®re cipher - Encryption alphabetic text using a series of interwoven shift ciphers, based on letters of a keyword

1. Choose a key e.g "Aston" (Numerical value of each letters is (0, 18, 19, 14, 13))
2. Split the text to be the same size as the key throughout 
3. Each letter give them their numerical value and another row below with the key values
4. Add the individual letters with the value from the key and mod 26
