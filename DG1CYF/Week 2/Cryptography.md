Decryption (Decoding, deciphering) - Reverse 

Plaintext - Original message

Ciphertext - The encrypted message

Key - device used to influence the way in which encryption and decryption are carried out

Cryptosystem (Cipher) - System for encryption and decryption


Substitution cipher - replace every letter in the message with letter that is a fixed number of positions further along in the alphabet

Modular arithmetic - When answer to a calculation must be in range 0 to m-1, where m is modulus
	ex. Result = 33 mod 26
	Result = 7 (Counting from 0 after 25) 


[[Vigen√®re]] cipher - Encryption alphabetic text using a series of interwoven shift ciphers, based on letters of a keyword
