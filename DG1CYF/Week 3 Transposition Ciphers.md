Transposition Cipher (Permutation Cipher) -  method of encryption which scrambles the position of characters
	Does not substitute one symbol for another, instead it changes the location of the symbols
Keyless transposition ciphers permute the characters by using writing plaintext and reading it another way 
	Rail Fence
Keyed transposition ciphers divide the plaintext into groups of predetermined size, called blocks and then use the key to permute the characters in each block separately
	Columnar 


Rail Fence Encrypting
Take phrase, write the plain text on n rows going down across up across down, read the rows such that it looks like this

HLORL          ->     HLORLEWOD
ELWOD


Rail Fence Decrypting
Take the phrase, write it out over given number of rows, read it as you wrote the text above so that it looks like this 

akan
tctw    ->      Attack At Dawn
tada
