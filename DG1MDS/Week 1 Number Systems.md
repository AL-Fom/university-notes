	Number Base/Radix
	Number of available symbols
	Decimal: Base 10 - 0 to 9
	Binary: Base 2 - 0 and 1
	Hexadecimal: Base 16 - 0 to 9, A (10) to F(15)

Decimal to Binary:
	Decimal / 2 = Quotient + Remainder
	Quotient / 2 = Quotient + Remainder 
	Repeat until you get to 0 Quotient, use the remainders are the binary value starting from bottom to top

Decimal to Hex
	Decimal / 16 = Quotient + Remainder
	Quotient / 16 = Quotient + Remainder
	Same as above


Binary to Decimal
	Insert binary values into the table below

| 128 | 64  | 32  | 16  | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
Binary to Hex
	Split the binary into Nibbles
	Each nibble adds up to 15 total

Hex to Decimal
	Take the place value of a number such that you do value*16^placeValue-1 

Hex to Binary
	Each place value is equivalent to a Nibble


Decimal Fractions to Binary
	Decimal * 2 = Quotient (1 or 0) + Remainder 
	Remainder * 2 = Quotient + Remainder
	Writing the Binary using quotient from top to bottom
