Propositional Statement is one that is either True or False 
	5>5 is a proposition that is false
	Can combine multiple propositions using logical operators (known as logical connectives) into a single proposition
		Proposition + Operator (AND, OR) + Proposition = Proposition
	Made up of Truth Values 
		True False
	Propositional Letters
		snowing -> s
		hailing -> h
		...
its important because it follows the programming structure use in many languages 
	if (a>b):
