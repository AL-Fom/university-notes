Predicate logic works with the following
	Works similarly to 
		Proposition: John plays the guitar
		Predicate: "Plays The"
		Objects: John, Guitar
		Math Notation: playsThe(John, Guitar)
	True False (Truth values)
	∧  ∨ ¬ (Logical operators)
	12 -5 0 3.141 ... (Term Values ℤ)
	x y z  (Term Variables)
	P Q R (Predicate Variables)
		Each Variable is restricted to a set
		For example playsThe{x,y} or P{x,y}
		x ∈ People
		y ∈ Instruments

A predicate can contain any of the above 
	such as P(V$_1$, V$_2$,..., V$_n$) this predicate has arity of n
	Ax example would be IsEdible(x) where "x" can be cake or glass (True or False)

The average predicate will look like:
	P(y) "y is prime" such that 
		4 is false 
		3 is true 
	this predicate has an arity of 1 
	a predicate of arity 2 would look like the following
	R(x,y) "x > y" where R(5,5) is false and R(6,5) is true

Another example of a predicate could be:
	R(x) is the predicate of P(5,y)
	P(5,y) is the predicate 5 > y
	if you substitute 5 for x you get 5>5 which is not true
