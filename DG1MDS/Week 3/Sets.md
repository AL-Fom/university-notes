Sets - Enumeration Notation 
	Notation is {x,y,z}
	Order is irrelevant {x,y,z,} == {y,z,x}
	Repetition is ignored so {x,x,y,z} = {x,y,z}


Cardinality
	The size of a set 
	The smallest set you can have is {} == ∅ (It's not the same as zero)
	The lines around the set "| |" is asking for the cardinality |{0,2,1}| <- 3
	|{}| = 0


Number Range Notation 
	{0,1,2,3,4,5} = {0,...,5}
	(1,2,3,...) = all positive 
	Special Number Ranges:
		{0,1,2,...} = ℕ (All Natural Numbers)
		(...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...) = ℤ (All Integers)


Set Membership Notation
	x ∈ S = object x is a member of set S
	y ∉ S = object is NOT a member of set S


Subsets 
	Set within another set
	S ⊆ T = set S is a subset of set T
	{1} ⊆ {1,2}
	{} ⊆ {1,2}
	{} ⊆ T
	{1} ⊄ {} (Not a subset as there cant be a 1 in an emtpy set)
	Any set is a subset of itself 

Set Builder Notation
	Enumeration:
		Let B be {1,2,3,4,5}
	Builder Notation 
		{X ∈ B | x >0 ∧ x < 6 }


Set Operators
	Union U
		Can be expressed as { x | x ∈ A ∨ x ∈ B } A OR B
	Intersection ∩
		Can be expressed as { x | x ∈ A ∧ x ∈ B } A AND B
	Difference \
		Can be expressed as { x | x ∈ A ∧ x ∉ B } A NOT B
