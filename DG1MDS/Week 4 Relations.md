Reflexivity 
	(∀x ∈ A) x R x
	All members of set a relates to itself 
	Example of the set 
	{x,y,z} the relation is {(x,x), (y,y), (z,z)} if you remove any of these its no longer reflexive

Symmetry
	(∀x ∈ A)(∀y ∈ A) (x R y ⇐⇒ y R x)
	x is related to y if y is related to x: two way relation
	Example of the set 
	{x,y,z} the relation is {(x,y), (y,x), (x,z), (z,x)}

Transitivity
	(∀x ∈ A)(∀y ∈ A)(∀z ∈ A) ((x R y ∧ y R z) ⇒ x R z)
	If A relates to Y, and Y relates Z, then X relates to Z kind of like skipping
	Example of the set
	{x,y,z} the relation {(x,y), (y,z), (x,z)}
