Linear:
f(x) =  mx+b

Quadratic:
ax$^2$ + bx + c
vertex is -b/2a

Exponential:
num$^x$ 

Logarithmic:
log$_n$$_u$$_m$x

A relation is is a subset of a cartesian product such that A$^2$
Let A = {1,2,4}
{(1,1),(1,2),(1,4),(2,1),(2,2),(2,4),....}
{ (x,y) E A * A | x divides y }
would end with a subset of {(1,1) (1,2) (1,4) (2,1) (2,2) (2,4) (4,4)}

Function with input X e A âŠ† R defined using addition, multi, exp, log, trig functions 
can be used to model reality: distance and time, height of ball bounce, etc. 
A function from set A to set B assigns to each element of A exactly one element of B
