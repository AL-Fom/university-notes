similar to a function although an equation has a single input per variable, whereas a function has a set of inputs per variable.

collection of equations that's one or more but usually more than one 

an augmented matrix 

(1,2,1) | 11
(3,1,2) | 14
(2,3,1) | 15

our target is 

(1,2,1) | 11
(0,1,2) | 14
(0,0,1) | 15

the rules are: 
	any two rows can be swapped 
	any row can be multiplied by a constant (e.g 5, 1.5, -2)
	a row can be added or subtracted from another row with the result overwriting the row

so if we get
(1,2,1) | 11
(3,1,2) | 14
(0,1,1) | 7

what we did is 2R$_1$ - R$_3$ > R$_3$

next we get
(1,2,1) | 11
(0,5,1) | 19
(0,1,1) | 7

we did 3R$_1$ - R$_2$ > R$_2$

and lastly we get 

(1,2,1) | 11
(0,5,1) | 19
(0,0,4) | 16

to get this final result we did 5R$_3$ - R$_2$ > R$_3$
